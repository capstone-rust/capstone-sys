**[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/capstone-sys/)**


**NOTE**:
We recommend against using this crate directly.
Instead, consider using [capstone-rs](https://github.com/capstone-rust/capstone-rs), which provides a high-level, "Rusty" interface.


## Requirements

* Rust version >= 1.19
    - We export [Rust unions], which were first stabilized with release 1.19
* A toolchain capable of compiling Capstone
    - We build the bundled Capstone with the [`cc` crate](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cc-rs)

[Rust unions]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/unions.html
